Effective Prototyping, Visualization
====================================

Prototyping is important. It allows Product Managers to validate
that an idea or concept has value before spending business resources
on planning and implementation.

The Traditional Wireframe
-------------------------

The traditional wireframe typically looks like a series of boxes
representing various objects or components on the UI of the product
that you're creating.

In some advanced tools, wireframing has been made interactive,
where the screens themselves respond to clicks on various objects
and take you to the corresponding view or give the appropriate feedback.

Good, but lacking
-----------------

The traditional wireframe is good in that it allows you to go through
the flow of the application, and understand potential pitfalls in
sequences of events, and get a general idea for where things do and don't
work in terms of layout.

The problem is that a wireframe is limited in user experience. Seeing
black white and gray in the forms of boxes and ovals doesn't give a strong
indication of the feel of the product. The challenge is, though, that
it costs resources to have prettified UI elements like fancy buttons,
headers and footers, and color, and you don't want to spend heavy
engineering and design resources to get a quick prototype out.

Cue in the HTML Prototype
-------------------------

With HTML prototypes, oftentimes a lot of the hard work is done for you
already. If you have a website, then you most likely have the CSS and
layout code already set up to you. With a simple header, and footer,
and reference to the CSS stylesheet, everything you put in your HTML
prototype will already inherit the look and feel of your existing application.

It's low cost, low effort
-------------------------

You do have to ask your designer and one of your engineers for a little help,
but the amount of effort to do an HTML prototype is generally minimal.
The HTML code powering it is not meant to be scalable, or long term, and is definitely
meant to just quickly assemble things on the page so anyone testing the
prototype can get a full user experience. Stress to your engineer or designer
that they should be spending minimal effort on this and it shouldn't take more
than a day or two.

Your test users will love it
----------------------------

Not everyone has a colorful imagination or the capacity to visualize things.
Just because something has a logical flow doesn't mean it has a good user experience
when actually implemented. It might turn out that what makes sense in a series of
black and white rectangles and squares doesn't work as well when prettified
with actual UI element styles.

You will get better feedback
----------------------------

Apple says in its "Designed by Apple" video that one of their criteria in building
successful products isn't just what the product does, but how users feel when they
use the product. With a styled HTML prototype, you'll get a better idea of how
users feel when they operate with your prototype, and get a better idea of how
it will work when put into an actual production or pre-production environment.

You'll get more accurate and better feedback because you have taken the burden off
the user to have to visualize the product with actual styling, thus bringing you
one step closer to shipping a succesful product, all with a quality prototype that costs
very little, is easy to do, and has most of the hard work done already.
