Dual-Track Agile
================

Something that you might have heard about in the product space is "dual-track agile".
Dual-track agile means that discovery and delivery is in parallel. What does that mean? To understand where this originated from, you have to think back to how companies used to do things. Waterfall was the industry standard and the old way of doing things was to plan out an entire project, soup-to-nuts, with a set budget, set deadlines, and set timing. There were legitimate business reasons for doing this. You controlled budget and finances and in theory mitigated risks by putting everythign into nice little contained boxes. The problem is, that creating products in technologies is an evolutionary process. What you know and think today could easily change tomorrow as people gain greater insight into what it is they're doing, technology changes, etc.

So you have a product backlog filled with thousands of items. If the product backlog stayed static, then it'd be just like going back to the old way of doing things -- overplanning things out, instead of the new, agile way of doing things, where things are constantly evolving and changing.

The way we implemented dual-track agile at City.com was we had biweekly recap days. Every two weeks we'd spend an entire day with all of the people from each of the different departments (business/marketing/engineering/design/ux) and we'd re-assess where we were.

"Does it still make sense to work on this component yet? After getting user feedback, does it still make sense to do it this way? Has anything changed on the business landscape that should change our approach to doing this?"

By continuously re-assessing our situation, we continually adapted to changes in market currents, user attitude, technological capabilities, new ideas. And this also enabled us to groom the product backlog, making sure our user stories were focused, on point, had value, and were part of the strategic vision and roadmap of what it was we were trying to accomplish.

Just remember, just as you as a company are agile, so should be your product backlog!
