Hiring Exceptional Product Managers
===================================

Exceptional product managers are the people that get users, get the target market, are technically savvy, UI/UX aware, problem solvers.

So how then, in the interview process, do you find that person?

The way I hire people is that I want to learn about the way they think and their approach to, and how they solve problems.

Here are a couple of questions to figure out if those things align with the traits I look for in exceptional product managers:

> "At company XXX, what was the target market for your product? What needs did you identify with this target market 
> and how did you solve those problems?"

> "What are some challenges that you've run into in leading a product, and how did you address them?"

> "What would you name as your career accomplishments as a product manager?"

or,

> "Talk to me about some successful ideas that you've originated in your career,
> how you came up with them, and how they played out for the company you were
> working for."

I feel like a lot of people miss the boat in hiring or finding hidden talent, because companies like to mitigate risk. They like to hear that someone has managed a large team and has experience performing every industry buzzword on HR's list. When I hire, I'm looking for talent, people that will serve as drivers of change and originators of new ideas that will take business in ways that people haven't thought of yet, and reach untapped markets and ideas. Those people are people with creativity, problem solving, and discipline in management.
