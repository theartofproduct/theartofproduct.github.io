Traits of Exceptional Product Managers
======================================

What makes an exceptional Product Manager? The role of product manager is evolving in the tech space. Product Management often came from the business analyst side, as someone who oversaw the development process, scoped out requirements, defined the strategy and roadmap, and helped resolve issues along the way.

Technology however has become really competitive, and simply overseeing a process won't make you stand out from your competitors. The top product managers don't simply manage a process, but are also creators of ideas.

So what makes an exceptional product manager?

**User empathy**
----------------

An exceptional product manager understands the target market that he or she is working with.
The product manager understands things like the mindset the user is in during usage of the product,
can identify in advance potential pitfalls, and can understand and identify the goals of the user
when using the product.

**Understands the business dynamics of the target industry**
------------------------------------------------------------

This ties into user empathy as knowing the target market ties into understanding how the different dynamics of the business play together to create revenues

**Technical chops**
-------------------

Exceptional product managers know what's going on in the tech space, so they can make the most competitive decisions in where they can take their products, but also understand the limitations so they can appropriately manage budget and resource constraints

**Knows good UI/UX**
--------------------

Technology has transcended merely delivering a service, but also how that service is delivered, and how people feel when they use your product. The entire user experience being simple, easy to get, and natural are key qualities. A good product resonates with the people, allowing it to organically and exponentially grow in usage

**Analytical and objective with data**
--------------------------------------

In this world of big data, we can harvest large amounts of data, and a good Product Manager can interpret that data to make informed decisions. An exceptional product manager can also define what the best indicators and data points will describe the criteria for success.

**Leadership qualities that allow things to get done**
------------------------------------------------------

An exceptional product manager knows how to build consensus, keep the team motivated, and manage time, expectations, and morale while getting stuff done

Put all of these things together and you have an amazing product manager. But how then do you find such a person? I talk about that in another article, Hiring Exceptional Product Managers.
