<p>One thing that I see frequently in the technology industry is the Product Gimmick.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A Product Gimmick is when you add a feature to your product that incentivizes users to perform an action not related to the primary activity that the user is investing him or herself into when using your product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Product Gimmicks tend to be novelty features that provide short-term value. They often arise as copycat ideas from fads, whereby a stakeholder believes that because something worked for some other product, it could possibly work for that stakeholder’s product. This often results in wasted resources that could have been saved otherwise.</p>

<p>Successful businesses look at ideas as solutions to problems. An idea for the sake of an idea, does not provide as much of a strategy and path to value as an idea for the sake of solving a problem. Thus:</p>

<h2 id="how_to_avoid_creating_a_product_gimmick">How to Avoid Creating a Product Gimmick</h2>

<p><strong>1. Identify What Problem Your Product is Solving</strong></p>

<p>What value does your product bring to its users? What problem are you solving? What utility does your product provide?</p>

<p>Using some successful companies as examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter provides microblogging</li>

<li>Instagram provides image sharing</li>

<li>Vine provides micro-“vlog”ing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Ask if the feature you’re providing directly adds to or complements the problem your product solves</strong></p>

<p>Instagram provides an image sharing service. Therefore the ability to edit your photos directly adds or complements to what the central utility of Instagram provides.</p>

<p>An example of a Product Gimmick that would fail this test is if your product were a fashion blog and you provided users the ability to “level up” and “gain experience” through comments and likes.</p>

<h2 id="side_effects_of_product_gimmicks">Side Effects of Product Gimmicks</h2>

<p>A Product Gimmick that is entirely new and completely unrelated can provide novelty in the form of something that excites people through being drastically different from the experience. Oftentimes you may experience a temporary surge as people experiment with something new. But as you will find over time, users use your product for a specific reason / intent. And actions that are not related to that primary utility will decay over time.</p>

<h2 id="adding_a_successful_product_feature">Adding a Successful Product Feature</h2>

<p>Therefore, the most effective way to add a successful Product feature is indeed:</p>

<p>To add features that directly add or complement the problem your product solves.</p>
