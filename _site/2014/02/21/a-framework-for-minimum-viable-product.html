<p>Minimum Viable Product is a term thrown around a lot in the tech industry right now. It represents the minimum iteration of a product such that it has all of the features required for it to be viable, in a literal sense.</p>

<h2 id="easy_to_say_hard_to_do">Easy to say, hard to do</h2>

<p>Everyone’s shooting for Minimum Viable Product, but oftentimes the task of identifying what the MVP is is easier said than done. As this is something that needs to be done so frequently in the tech world, I’ve come up with a framework that works for me in getting MVP done.</p>

<h2 id="why_mvp_is_important">Why MVP is important</h2>

<h2 id="solution_be_a_problem_solver">Solution: Be a Problem Solver</h2>

<p>Products don’t exist for no reason. They exist to provide a utility or solve a problem. Thus,</p>

<h2 id="step_1_identify_the_problem_youre_trying_to_solve">Step 1: Identify the Problem You’re Trying to Solve</h2>

<p>OK, so let’s say I have a hypothetical movie tickets website. What problem am I trying to solve?</p>

<p><strong>To provide a platform where users can purchase a ticket for a movie online.</strong></p>

<p>Now let’s list out features that this movie tickets website could have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reviews</li>

<li>Ratings</li>

<li>Cart + Checkout</li>

<li>Movie search</li>

<li>User registration</li>

<li>Favoriting movies</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a lot of ideas for how this movie website should be done. How do I decide which should and should not go into the first version of my application?</p>

<h2 id="step_2_for_every_feature_ask_yourself_if_it_is_directly_related_to_solving_the_core_problem">Step 2: For every feature, ask yourself if it is directly related to solving the core problem</h2>

<p>The problem I am trying to solve is:</p>

<p><strong>To provide a platform where users can purchase a ticket for a movie online.</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, the template question for each feature would be:</p>

<p><strong>Does feature XXX directly provide a platform where users can purchase a ticket for a movie online?</strong></p>

<p>Reviews? No.</p>

<p>Ratings? No.</p>

<p>Cart + Checkout? Yes. You cannot purchase a ticket without checking out</p>

<p>Movie search? Yes. You can’t purchase a ticket without being able to locate the movie you want to watch.</p>

<p>User registration? No. You don’t need to be a member of a website to purchase a ticket. There may be business requirements to have user registration for marketing purposes, but it is not an essential piece – it is not solving the problem. Many mobile applications simply work without requiring user registration. This is a relic of the past.</p>

<p>Favoriting movies? No. I can buy tickets without bookmarking or favoriting things</p>

<h2 id="and_voila">And voila!</h2>

<p>I’ve now boiled down the requirements for my MVP to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cart + Checkout</li>

<li>Movie search</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve now identified the MVP. Now that I’ve identified the MVP, the next steps are to validate it against the target market. Then as users request features, we can add them.</p>

<p>The most successful products in the world are the ones that distinctly and effectively solve the problem and provide a unique utility and experience that no other product is giving.</p>
