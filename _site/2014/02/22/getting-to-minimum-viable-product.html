                <h1 id="getting_to_minimum_viable_product">Getting to Minimum Viable Product</h1>

<p>One of the biggest things I’ve noticed in my career is a failure to grasp what an effective MVP really is. Oftentimes in a product you have a lot of different stakeholders and interests in the product all coming at different angles telling you what is “absolutely necessary” for the product to succeed. However it is often the case that several of the features being proposed do not define the features required for the Minimum Viable Product. To really understand what an MVP is, you have to understand why MVP is important.</p>

<h2 id="why_is_mvp_important">Why is MVP important?</h2>

<p>MVP is important because you want to be sure that the product that you are creating has value and that your initial focus in the development process is the set of core features that define the inherent value of your product. If your product isn’t delivering significant, competitive value, people will not use it. If people are not using your product, then you should not spend resources developing features for a product that people will not use.</p>

<p>If your product is not yet delivering competitive, distinct value, then your primary focus should be on finding out how to deliver that value.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, the Minimum Viable Product is the set of features that define the core value of your product such that it is viable in the market.</strong></p>

<p>Now that we’ve established what Minimum Viable Product is and what it means, I’m going to share the steps of my framework to define the MVP of a product, along with a hypothetical example.</p>

<h2 id="step_1_identify_the_problem_youre_trying_to_solve">Step 1: Identify the Problem You’re Trying to Solve</h2>

<p>For our purposes, let’s say our hypothetical product is a movie tickets website. So my first question to myself is, what problem am I trying to solve?</p>

<p><strong>To provide a platform where users can purchase a ticket for a movie online.</strong></p>

<p>Now that we’ve established what product we’re going to create, let’s iterate a sample set of features that could possibly exist in a movie tickets website.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reviews</li>

<li>Ratings</li>

<li>Cart + Checkout</li>

<li>Movie search</li>

<li>User registration</li>

<li>Favoriting movies</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we’ve established a list of potential features, let’s move on to the next step.</p>

<h2 id="step_2_for_every_feature_ask_yourself_if_it_is_directly_related_to_solving_the_core_problem">Step 2: For every feature, ask yourself if it is directly related to solving the core problem</h2>

<p>Let’s think again what problem it is that we’re trying to solve:</p>

<p><strong>To provide a platform where users can purchase a ticket for a movie online.</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, the template question for each feature will be:</p>

<p><strong>Does feature XXX directly provide a platform where users can purchase a ticket for a movie online?</strong></p>

<p>Reviews? No.</p>

<p>Ratings? No.</p>

<p>Cart + Checkout? Yes. You cannot purchase a ticket without checking out</p>

<p>Movie search? Yes. You can’t purchase a ticket without being able to locate the movie you want to watch.</p>

<p>User registration? No. You don’t need to be a member of a website to purchase a ticket. There may be business requirements to have user registration for marketing purposes, but it is not an essential piece – it is not solving the problem. Many mobile applications simply work without requiring user registration. This is a relic of the past.</p>

<p>Favoriting movies? No. I can buy tickets without bookmarking or favoriting things</p>

<h2 id="and_voila">And voila!</h2>

<p>I’ve now boiled down the requirements for my MVP to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cart + Checkout</li>

<li>Movie search</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve now identified the MVP. Now that I’ve identified the MVP, the next steps are to validate it against the target market. Then as users request features, we can add them.</p>

<p>The most successful products in the world are the ones that distinctly and effectively solve the problem and provide a unique utility and experience that no other product is giving.</p>
