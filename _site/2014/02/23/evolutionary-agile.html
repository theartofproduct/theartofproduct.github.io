<p>When discussing the agile methodology, people often use the word “iterative”. The concept of agile came out as a response to the failures of strict waterfall methodology, and created a process open to change consisting of an iterative series of development blocks called sprint, which afforded managers the opportunity to address inevitable changes and occurrences that happen along the development process.</p>

<p>While iterative is a good way to describe the agile process, a paradigm shift is occurring in the technology industry as businesses begin to understand that creating a quality product transcends simply fulfilling a need, but providing a quality user experience, with distinctive, competitive utility presented in a way that users can just get and makes users feel good and happy about using the product.</p>

<p>From this experience-driven approach, we’re seeing a user-centric focus. And we’re learning that it isn’t simply enough to repeat the iterative process. The process and the product must exhibit intelligence, and learning. And there is no better word to describe this paradigm shift in our industry than evolutionary.</p>

<p>The use of the word evolutionary helps keep in mind that the key to creating successful products is to ensure that the progression of the product expresses learning throughout exposure to the target market. To better understand the angle that I’m describing, let’s explore a few definitions (source Merriam-Webster):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>natural selection</strong><br />a natural process that results in the survival and reproductive success of individuals or groups best adjusted to their environment and that leads to the perpetuation of genetic qualities best suited to that particular environment<br />“As proposed by Charles Darwin, natural selection is the mechanism by which evolution occurs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How are those qualities chosen?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>learn</strong><br />to gain knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>in·tel·li·gence</strong><br />the ability to learn or understand things or to deal with new or difficult situations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through experience, we learn, and can therefore select the best qualities (features).</p>

<p>From the evolution we can view the framework for intelligent product design. Let’s use the classic example to demonstrate this concept.</p>

<p>On the Galapagos island there were a series of finches. Darwin noticed that various birds had evolved specific mutations. The mutations that were found to be superior on the island were kept and carried on through the next generation. The mutations that were inferior or ineffective were removed from the gene pool in successive generations.</p>

<p>In Product terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>A finch is the product.</li>

<li>Each of the genetic mutations of the finch is a part of a multivariate test testing different qualities (features) that the finch could have</li>

<li>Through mutation being exposed directly to the finch’s target environment, we can learn whether or not the quality (feature) was successful, intelligently select the superior qualities that have been proven to be successful</li>
</ul>

<p>And from this, we can develop the following framework for intelligent, evolutionary product design:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define your product</li>

<li>Define your target environment</li>

<li>Expose prospective ideas or features to the product’s native environment</li>

<li>Learn from analyzing the results of this exposure</li>

<li>Select the appropriate features</li>

<li>Continue generating ideas and repeating the learning process</li>
</ol>

<p>The key components that make this process distinct is the continual introduction of features or ideas into the target environment / market of the product, and using that as a basis to improve the product.</p>
