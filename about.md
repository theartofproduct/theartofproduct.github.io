About
=====

Hi, my name is Peter.

I've been building products in technology for over fifteen years.

I've built video games, e-commerce applications, RESTful APIs,
mobile applications, and a lot of other cool things.

I like talking to people about product management and technology,
preferably over Blue Bottle coffee :)
