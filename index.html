<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>
My name is Peter and I've been working in technology
for over fifteen years, in roles ranging from 
engineer to CTO to Product Manager. Throughout this time
I've learned alot about what does and doesn't work in the technology
industry, and have created this blog to share my experiences, foster
discussion, and provide a platform where we can all learn from one another.
